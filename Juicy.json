It's all good, baby baby\n[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nIt was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine\nSalt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine\nHangin' pictures on my wall\nEvery Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl\nI let my tape rock 'til my tape popped\nSmokin' weed in Bamb\u00fa, sippin' on Private Stock\nWay back, when I had the red and black lumberjack\nWith the hat to match\nRemember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha\nYou never thought that hip-hop would take it this far\nNow I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight\nTime to get paid, blow up like the World Trade\nBorn sinner, the opposite of a winner\nRemember when I used to eat sardines for dinner\nPeace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri\nFunkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski\nI'm blowin' up like you thought I would\nCall the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good\nAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga\nYou might also like[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]\nYou know very well (Yeah)\nWho you are (Money, hoes and clothes)\nDon't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)\nReach for the stars (It's all good)\nYou had a goal (C'mon)\nBut not that many (It's all good)\n'Cause you're the only one\nI'll give you good and plenty (Check it)\n\n[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nI made the change from a common thief\nTo up close and personal with Robin Leach\nAnd I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day\nSpread love, it's the Brooklyn way\nThe Mo\u00ebt and Aliz\u00e9 keep me pissy, girls used to diss me\nNow they write letters 'cause they miss me\nI never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff\nI was too used to packing gats and stuff\nNow honeys play me close like butter play toast\nFrom the Mississippi down to the East Coast\nCondos in Queens, indo for weeks\nSold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak\nLiving life without fear\nPuttin' five karats in my baby girl ear\nLunches, brunches, interviews by the pool\nConsidered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school\nStereotypes of a black male misunderstood\nAnd it's still all good\nAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga\n[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]\nYou know very well (C'mon)\nWho you are (Bankrolls)\nDon't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)\nReach for the stars (Mansions)\nYou had a goal\nBut not that many (It's all good)\n'Cause you're the only one\nI'll give you good and plenty ('94)\n\n[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]\nSuper Nintendo, Sega Genesis\nWhen I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this\n50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa\nGot two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur\nPhone bill about two G's flat\nNo need to worry, my accountant handles that\nAnd my whole crew is loungin'\nCelebrating every day, no more public housin'\nThinkin' back on my one-room shack\nNow my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back\nAnd she loves to show me off of course\nSmiles every time my face is up in The Source\nWe used to fuss when the landlord dissed us\nNo heat, wonder why Christmas missed us\nBirthdays was the worst days\nNow we sip Champagne when we thirsty\nUh, damn right I like the life I live\n'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)\nAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga\n[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]\nYou know very well (Money)\nWho you are (Hoes and clothes)\nDon't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)\nAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga\nReach for the stars (That's right)\nYou had a goal (It's all good)\nBut not that many (All good)\n'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)\nI'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)\nAnd if you don't know, now you know, nigga\n\n[Post-Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]\nRepresentin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)\nJunior Mafia, mad flavor (Bad Boy)\nUh, uh, yeah, aight (I see you, Cooch)\n\n[Chorus: Total]\nYou know very well\nWho you are\nDon't let 'em hold you down\nReach for the stars\nYou had a goal\nBut not that many\n'Cause you're the only one\nI'll give you good and plenty\n\n[Outro: Puff Daddy & Total]\nBiggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga\nJunior Mafia, it's all good, nigga\nBad Boy, it's all good, nigga\nIt's all good\nThat's right, '94\nAnd on and on, and on and on\nYou know very well\nIt's all good\nWho you are\nYeah\nDon't let 'em hold you down\nReach for the stars\n[Produced by Pete Rock and Poke of Trackmasters]390Embed"
