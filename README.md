## About the Project
Hip-Hop Genie is inspired by the desire to not only find specific lyrics but also to deconstruct them and even create your own. With Hip-Hop Genie, you can:
- Find information on your favorite artists and their songs.
- Create your own lyrics with the help of advanced AI.

Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Genius API, alongside ChatGPT and Llama-Index, Hip-Hop Genie provides a comprehensive tool for hip-hop enthusiasts and aspiring lyricists.

## Why not ChatGPT?
Unlike ChatGPT, Hip-Hop Genie does not have the most up-to-date information. As of this post, Hip-Hop Genie has data up to January 2022.

3. Set up the Genius API key:

   - Create a `.env` file and add your API key: `GENIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key`
4. Run the application: `python app.py`
